# Concepts

This section explains the core concepts behind Shepherd Model Gateway. Understanding these concepts helps you design, deploy, and operate SMG effectively.

## What is SMG?

Shepherd Model Gateway is an **inference gateway** that adapts to your deployment:

| With gRPC Workers | With HTTP Workers | With External APIs |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Full OpenAI server | Intelligent proxy | Unified routing |
| Tokenization + caching | Load balancing | Model discovery |
| Tool parsing + MCP | PD disaggregation | Provider abstraction |
| Reasoning loops | Health-aware failover | API translation |

Unlike generic load balancers, SMG understands LLM patterns: prefix caching, token streaming, and KV cache affinity.

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [API Layer](architecture/overview.md) | Inference, utility, and admin endpoints |
| [Router Manager](routing/load-balancing.md) | Selects path based on worker type |
| [Service Discovery](architecture/service-discovery.md) | Health monitoring, worker registration |

## Design Principles

SMG is built on several core principles:

1. **Transparency**: SMG should be invisible to well-behaved applications. The same requests that work against a single worker should work through SMG.

2. **Performance**: Routing decisions happen in microseconds. SMG never becomes the bottleneck.

3. **Reliability**: Individual worker failures don't cause application failures. SMG routes around problems automatically.

4. **Observability**: You can always understand what SMG is doing through metrics, traces, and logs.

5. **Simplicity**: Common cases are simple. Advanced features are available but not required.
